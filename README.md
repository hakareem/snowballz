# Snowballz
 I have used HTML & CSS & Typescript to build this project. This is an online multiplayer game. This was undeniably one of the best projects I have built so far. I have worked in a team of 4 other talented aspiring developers. We wanted to create something different, original and exciting. We then agreed on the idea of creating a snowball fight game that we can play and share with other people.
 
# Learning Experience 
This was a special learning opportunity for me. I was able to demonstrate my skills using Git to push, pull, create and merge branches. It was great in improving my attention to detail skills to resolve merge conflicts. We worked as part of a team to share ideas, help each other to resolve issues we faced. 

# Areas for improvement
I have made some observations on what can be Improved. Some features to add include:

• Realistic sprites <br>
• Improve Player Synchronisation <br>
• Support smaller devices (mobile) <br>
• Add an event log <br>
• Add snow footprints  <br>
• Expand player area <br>
• Create character animations <br>
